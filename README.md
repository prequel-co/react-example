# Getting Started with the Prequel React Example App

This example app shows how you can use hooks from [@prequel/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prequel/react) in your own application. These hooks enable you to build a form that allows users to register their warehouses as Prequel destinations. This example app contains no styling and uses generic browser form components in order to minimize dependencies. For more details on usage of [@prequel/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prequel/react), please see our [docs](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/react).
