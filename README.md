# Getting Started with the Prequel React Example App

This example app shows a sample Create Destination form that demonstrates how you can use hooks from [@prequel/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prequel/react) to build a self-serve form in your application that allows users to register their destinations. This example app contains no styling and uses generic browser form components in order to minimize dependencies. For more details on usage of [@prequel/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prequel/react), please see our [docs](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/react).
